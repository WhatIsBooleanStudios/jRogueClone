# JRogueClone

Rogue is a terminal-based dungeon crawling adventure developed at U.C Berkley in the 80s where the player fights through endless hords monsters, collects
terrifying weapons, and a wide variety of weapons. JRogueClone hopes to deliver the same amount of fun or more that users in the 80s experienced to players
today. Join **WhatIsBooleanStudios** as we embark on yet another adventure.
