# JRogueClone

Rogue is a terminal-based dungeon crawling adventure developed at U.C Berkley in the 70s where the player fights through endless hords monsters, collects
terrifying weapons, and a wide variety of weapons. JRogueClone hopes to deliver the same amount of fun or more that users in the 70s experienced to players
today. Join **WHAT IS BOOLEAN** sutdios as we embark on yet another adventure.

## Fighting
Move into the enemy to hurt them. That's it.
  
## Weapons
These can be picked up from loot boxes. Some are good and some are bad. All weapons have a damage, a hit chance, and a maximum durability. Every time you attack
a monster, you have a chance (displayed on the weapon's name in the inventory) to deal the weapon's damage (displayed on the weapon's name in the inventory) to
the monster. Everytime you hit a monster 1 is subtracted from the weapon's durability (You know where you can find this). When the weapon's durability hits
0, the weapon breaks. A new one is automatically equipped if you have one available. Otherwise, you are a sitting duck for a monster to kill you. Be sure
to have multiple weapons on you at all times!
  
## Monsters
  
| Name     | Description|
|----------|------------|
| Bat      | Low health. Annoying flying mammals. There are so many of them, it's kinda hard to believe that they're endangered. But you're stuck in a dungeon so who cares |
| Snake    | Low health. Annoying slithering reptile. A reptile with the personality of a bat. |
| Eye      | A floating eye. It can't damage you physically so it'll do it emotionally |
| Skeleton | Mischevious little rascals. It may seem like they're just trying to give you a hug. Really, they're trying to make you die of tetnis with that rusty weapon of theirs. Beware! |
| Orc      | This big guy's as lost as you. As he is built like a tank, it may take a few whacks to get through him |
| Snowman  | I have no clue how this thing exists. It isn't even below freezing in the dungeon. Impossibility aside, don't let this guy hit you. You might get frozen! |
  
 ## Inventory
 Press I and look at the bottom
  
## Final words
  
Have fun!
